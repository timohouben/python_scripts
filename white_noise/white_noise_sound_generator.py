# A stereo "White Noise" generator using STANDARD Python 2.5.2 or higher.
# This is for (PC)Linux(OS), (ONLY?), and was done purely for fun.
#
# It is another simple piece of testgear for the amateur electronics
# enthusiast and uses /dev/dsp instead of /dev/audio. Enjoy... ;o)

# Ensure the sound is enabled and the volume is turned up.
#
# Copy the file to the Lib folder/drawer/directory where Python resides,
# or where the modules reside, as "noise.py" without the quotes.
#
# Start the Python interpreter from a console/terminal window.
#
# For a quick way to run the noise generator just use at the ">>>" prompt:-
#
# >>> import noise[RETURN/ENTER]
