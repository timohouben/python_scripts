    Simple two state Markov Chain based rainfall simulator.

    The simulator is based on that described by Richardson (1980). The retains an internal state of either wet or dry
    the transition probabilities are given for wet days based on a preceding wet or dry day. An exponential distirbution
    is used for the intensity of rainfall on wet days.

    The transition probabilities and intensity distribution parameter (lambda) are described using the AnnualHarmonicModel
    class which permits seasonal variation in the parameters.
